          <p>My first project for J365 was to create a front page newspaper spread. When originally looking at the assignment I thought it would be easy to execute. But with anything in design there are rules and guidelines that help you along the way. To start out we drew a sketch to layout how we wanted to assemble our pieces together so that took some time as well as trial and errors. My partner Michelle and I going into the project knew a general basis what our outline was going to look like from some previous newspapers we got ideas from and their layout. We chose to do a 6 grid style so that we could fit out prominent story on the top half of the page. When trying to decide what fonts we wanted to use we chose to use three different font families Rockwell, Source Serif, and Georgia.</p>
          <p>Both Michelle and I decided to play around with what we wanted to do with our promos. We originally had our promos at the bottom of our front page but then decided it was better to be seen at the top. We also had a bit of a setback when we decided that our main story didn't have as much space with three columns so we had to rearrange and prioritize stories and figure out which stories were more important. From there we decided which are more important to be on the top side of the front page. Our creative direction  with the promos were to add a faded element to it so the Colts and Beetlejuice were connected someway visually. When deciding where to put bylines and decks we would play around with spacing and see what we could come up with so Michelle and I were very flexible in how we assembled our designs and layouts as far as the project went.</p> 
          <p>Moving into how we split the work up Michelle started on the layout of the newspaper on indesign and I started on the styles document and then moved to help her with inserting the stories into the document. After we added the stories and wrapped text with pictures we went back in and touched up spacing making sure out font size was 12 for the stories 40 for the headings. My experience with this project was unique because being an advertising major I don't work a lot with stories and more creative concepts and applying them so it was fun to learn. Overall it was a unique experience and Michelle and I worked very well together helping each other see things from different perspectives and understanding how newspaper designs should look and work.</p>

          <div><p>When I was first introduced to this project I was a little hesitant with how much creative leeway I had. My thought process was to start with the cover and work my way down to the ASF. For the cover I chose the clock tower photo because of how much room there was the add the headliners on the side to where it would be visually appealing to the eye. For the cover text color I used the eye dropping tool to take the color from the tower to to put on the text on the far left. For the magazine’s issued headline I had done some research on London based magazine’s and found a similar font to the one’s on the magazines I was looking to reference. 
          <p>I wanted it to be long her and a little more sophisticated and elegant so I chose Minion Pro bold. For my second and third pages I wanted to do a two page spread to start out the story about the underground tube and map. I chose the picture of the man walking in front of the tube because I thought it fit the story perfectly and with the headline “Going Underground” it made sense to put the tube which is underground the city. The picture was a little busy so I chose white for it to pop and added the grey to the bottom because it popped on the lighter floor. The fourth and fifth pages had a lot of creative work to figure out.
          To visualize where I was going to put pictures and the sidebar I decided to sketch it out on my dummy page to get a sense where everything would go. The side bar became red to match the cohesive theme of Britains flag and the posters fit accordingly on the sidebar the way I laid it out.<p>The font I used for the text was Benton Sans regular, because it is a sans font for text and I remembered it from class. In terms of the picture of Harry Beck, I thought it would add a nice touch to add him into the article in reference to him and his map. The underground sign was another visual element to tie back into the underground tube and how Harry Beck created the system. On my final page I wanted it to still be cohesive with the rest of the magazine so I added a double added headline for the six icons of British designs. Originally I wanted to make a timeline of the icons that came first to last but the layout was weird and the spacing did not add up. After trial and error I spaced them out evenly in two lines with their captions following right below. I decided to take the postcard stamps with a red outline again to follow the cohesiveness of the British flag. This project was a little tricky for me but I eventually understood what worked in the designs and what did so I finished with something I was proud of.</p></div>

          <!-- Add the JPEG version of your Infographic here, linking to the PDF -->
          <p>For my third project in J365 my partner Lucas and I chose to do an infographic about the change in sales between streaming platforms and physical vinyl sales. More specifically we chose the time frame of the past decade that has seen a big change from what everyone thought streaming would be the main source of music until vinyl records hit a high. Lucas did the first bar graph on the sales of streaming and physical album copies from 2013-2023. On the left of the graph Lucas created a visual of streaming to physical changes by applying headphones connected to a vinyl record. When creating the theme of the overall infographic we wanted to implement the shelves of vinyls to resemble the headline "The Music Industry From Shelves to Streaming".</p><p> We took the colors from that initial photo from Adobe Stock and put it in our graphs and charts used. At the bottom of our infographic I created a pie chart of the percentages of the top 2023 sales of the top 10 album vinyl sales list from Neilson Media Research. Again I used the colors that were applied throughout the infographic to color in the pie chart. To the right side of the infographic I picked a vinyl to put in the corner for another visual element that would tie in the whole page. On the vinyl I put the album covers of the top 2023 vinyl album sales in the top 10 list. The headline font we used was Arial which was the easiest and most visible font on the picture at the top on the yellow hue we used.</p>

          <p>This poster project was something that I was looking forward to do because of how much creative freedom we were given. I didn’t feel super confident in the other projects that we had, but maybe that was because I was given all of my visual elements and had to make them work together. For this project I got to come up with what I was producing but also how I wanted to draw it out. I would be lying if I said the first thing I started on this project didn’t take me a while. I started off with the drawing of Sabrina Carpenter and the outline of her. This was fairly easy, but the hard part was making sure I get the textures of her hair and the curls. For her hair I changed the opacity of the image I was referencing and would trace the predominate curls that were on the outline of her hair. Every once and a while I would turn the opacity to 0% to make sure I could visualize who this would be and that is when I had to start drawing her face.
            <p>The face was fairly simple but the eyes are what was the hardest part because I couldn’t position them in the direction of her body and the reference photo was a bit hard to visualize because the pixels up close didn’t show the details of her eyes. With this being said I wanted to play around with a different element of shading in and that is when I decided not to add her eyes to the visual. For the dark parts of her hair I chose to layer it underneath the back side of her head and under some of the wavy parts I created for the hair. The coloring of my sketch was a bit challenging and time consuming because I had to outline the lining of the pen tool I did and go back and layer the lines above the color so it all looked concise and not like someone who can’t draw inside the lines. The lips on her shoulder were a last minute touch because on her album cover she has lips on the back of her shoulder so I substituted it for her front shoulder. I outlined a stock photo of the lips because the outline of the one on her album looked more like a blob with no definition. As a designer I think I could be better at using fonts and the placement of them in a more compelling way, but for me personally I don’t think the typography element is what I look for when viewing a piece of graphic design. I like my work to be minimalistic and balanced out.</p>
